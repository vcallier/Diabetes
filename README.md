# Diabetes
This is a repository for my project in the data mining/statistical learning course. The goal of this project is to use different methods to try to predict which individuals will get diabetes, based on variables in the dataset about diabetes in Pima Indians. I am implementing logistic regression, KNN classification, decision trees, and some other methods to compare the predictions.
